	* fix internal MD5 header to be 64-bit clean

	* do not assume size_t is unsigned int

	* removed locale-specific tests.  These were really to check bugs
	in perl 5.8.0 and are obsolete now.  They also make the test suite
	fail in some environments that don't have all the locales fully
	configured.

	* updated several files for gcc 4.3 (extra includes)
