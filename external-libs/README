NOTE: These copies of external libraries are not used by default.  You
must explicitly specific --enable-build-external-libraries on the
command-line in order to use them.  This is not recommended unless you
have no other option.  It can be especially useful for building on
Windows.

The pcre and zlib directories here contain pcre 4.5 and zlib 1.2.3.3
from debian (dfsg).  All files were removed that are not either
required to build or that contain some kind of copyright or
acknowledgment information.  Other than as described below, everything
else was left unmodified.

These files:

./pcre/pcre.h
./pcre/config.h

were copied from pcre.in and config.in and modified as follows:
